## Mini Algorithm Exercise

"Odds From Evens"

### Objectives

- Create an algorithm which takes a given array of integers (arr) and separates the odds from the evens.
- The output should be a new array which has all even integers (ordered from lowest to highest) followed by all odd integers (ordered from highest to lowest).

> i.e.:
> input => `[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`
> output => `[0,2,4,6,8,9,7,5,3,1]`

### Getting Started
